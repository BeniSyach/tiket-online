<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Nusa Travel to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we&rsquo;ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">How Do We Protect Your Information?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Nusa Travel or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Could my information be transferred to other countries?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Nusa Travel is incorporated in Indonesia. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Is the information collected through the Nusa Travel Service secure?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">What is GDPR?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control&nbsp;the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers&rsquo; data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">What is personal data?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person&rsquo;s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;-Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;-Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;-Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&nbsp;-People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Why is GDPR important?</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Nusa Travel we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We are committed to helping our customers meet the&nbsp;data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Nusa Travel processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer&nbsp;support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.</p>
<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">California Residents</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose categories of Personal Information we collect and how we use it, the categories of sources from whom we collect Personal Information, and the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained above.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We are also required to communicate information about rights California residents have under California law. You may exercise the following rights:</p>
